```
Verse 1:
Every day I see your face
Every day I hear your voice
Every day we have a choice
To shed tears or rejoice

Verse 2:
Every day we make mistakes
Every day a heart it breaks
We see what we can take
We find out what we forsake

Chorus:
Life goes on and on, again 
There's no need to pretend
Life goes on and on, my friend
We will meet in the end

Verse 3:
Every day someone lies
Every day a love it dies
Every day a child cries
And eyes, look up to the skies

Chorus

Verse 4:
Every day we kneel and pray
One day we'll find out way
The path our futures lay
And carry on come what may

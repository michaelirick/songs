```
Verse 1:
Born in a dark distant land
He knew battle in the womb
All who before him stand
Will lie in a nameless tomb
Dark figures hiding in the mist
Fast found friend fiendish foe
Axe haft clenched in iron fist
The bodies lay in blood-stained snow

Chorus:
Sullen-eyed Cimmerian
Raven haired sword in hand
Slayer with gigantic mirth
tread the jeweled thrones
of the Earth

Verse 2:
Gleaming towers and crystal spires
Shadowed vales and places deep
Valiant knights and loathsome liars
Black adders and things that creep
Gold and gems and maidens fair
Glory, fame, his name reknown
All these things he's seen his share
Now Conan comes for his crown

Chorus
```

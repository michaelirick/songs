```
Long ago on a quiet planet full of life
The traitor scum schemed and sowed their strife
With rebellion this peaceful place is rife
The balance hangs on the edge of a knife

Chorus:
Base Delta Zero
Now you done fucked up
Base Delta Zero
We're blowing your planet up

The time had come for them to unleash their plan
The rebels rose and the slaughter began
Our troops will be avenged to a man
Close your eyes, you may never see your planet again

Chorus

Our fleet arrives as you try to make a deal
For your treasons and for your foolish zeal
But you'll know as you're crushed beneath our heel
The notion of fear and how it feels

Chorus x 2

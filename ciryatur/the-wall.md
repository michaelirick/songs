```
Verse 1:
Long ago in ancient land
Darkness rose from the sand
Deadly evil of the East
Feel the fire of the Beast
Golden king from the West
Sword in hand on the quest
For the sake of us all
Will you heed the master's call?

Chorus:
Standing tall at the border
Loyal forces of Order
Keeping watch at the Wall
For the freedom of all

Verse 2:
Beacons tall all in line
Gazing east watchfires shine
Death comes for every man
Fighting we make our stand
Striving hard for our lives
For our children and wives
Under light of the Moon
Guarding from certain doom

Chorus
```

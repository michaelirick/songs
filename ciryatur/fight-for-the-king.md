Verse 1:
See our banners in the wind
Hear the trumpet, hear the din
Forth the Legion, six thousand men
Our peerless courage does not end
Before our king, you will crawl
Before his might you will fall
In the van, he stands tall
Siege engines breach your wall

Chorus:
Fight for the King
Raise your sword the air
Fight for the King
Feel the wind in your hair
Fight for the King
There's no time for despair
Fight for the King
Now for glory prepare

Verse 2:
Gleaming bright upon his brow
Sits the holy sacred crown
Ancient power from the West
Aids the king upon his quest
Imbued with second sight
No man he won't fight
Fire burns in his eyes
To rule all under the skies

Chorus

Verse 3:
Holy sword he will wield
Mystic power he reveals
To the king you will yield
or find your death in the find
Your city now will burn
For freedom you will yearn
For your pride you will learn
There will be no return

Chorus
```
